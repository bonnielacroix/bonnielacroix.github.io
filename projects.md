# Projects

## 1. Correlative Sample LIMS (PostgreSQL)

This system was designed around real oncology trial workflows, including
treatment cycles, progression events, biomarker-driven sampling, and
patient-level metadata that materially affects downstream analysis.

**Goal:**  
Design a scalable, auditable database for managing correlative
clinical-trial biospecimens.

**What I Built**
- Normalized PostgreSQL schema
- Controlled vocabularies and lookup tables
- Sample lifecycle tracking (collection → storage → movement)
- CDISC/CLIA-aware design considerations

**Key Skills Demonstrated**
- Relational modeling
- Schema-first thinking
- Clinical workflow translation into data structures
- Documentation and version control

## 2. Equipment Usage Tracking & Analytics

**Goal:**  
Automate equipment usage logging and generate operational insights.

**What I Built**
- PowerShell scripts capturing run metadata
- User and instrument normalization
- SharePoint-based ingestion
- Power BI dashboards with cumulative metrics

**Key Skills Demonstrated**
- Automation
- ETL-style thinking
- Operational analytics
- Data quality controls

## 3. Oncology Data Reasoning & QC Frameworks

This project reflects how clinical reality—pathology findings, treatment
timing, and patient characteristics—must be translated into precise,
auditable variables for real-world data analysis.

**Goal:**  
Demonstrate clinical abstraction logic used in real-world oncology data.

**What I Document**
- Variable definitions
- Source prioritization (structured vs notes)
- Date reconciliation logic
- Handling ambiguity and missingness

**Key Skills Demonstrated**
- Clinical reasoning
- Real-world data QC
- Documentation clarity
- Decision traceability
