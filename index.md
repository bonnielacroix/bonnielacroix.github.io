# Clinical Data & Research Operations Portfolio

I am a biomedical research operations leader transitioning into
clinical data and analytics roles. I specialize in:

- Translational oncology and real-world data reasoning
- Relational database design (PostgreSQL, SQL)
- Data validation, QC frameworks, and documentation
- Research operations automation and systems thinking

My clinical data expertise is grounded in direct interaction with
oncology-derived clinical materials, biomarker development, treatment
context, and downstream analytic needs—not solely EHR abstraction.

My work focuses on making messy clinical and research data
**trustworthy, interpretable, and usable**.
