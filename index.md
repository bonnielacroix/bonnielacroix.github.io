### Clinical Data & Research Operations Portfolio

I am a biomedical research operations leader transitioning into
clinical data and analytics roles. I specialize in:

- Relational database design (PostgreSQL, SQL)
- Data validation, QC frameworks, and documentation
- Research operations automation and systems thinking

My work focuses on making messy clinical and research data
**trustworthy, interpretable, and usable**.
