title: Bonnie LaCroix -- Clinical Data & Translational Informatics Portfolio
description: Hi, I'm **Bonnie LaCroix**
I work at the intersection of *oncology*, *clinical sample workflows*, and *data structure design*.  
My background in translational research and molecular biology has naturally evolved into a passion for:

- Data modeling  
- Clinical data structure development  
- QC and abstraction logic  
- Real-world oncology data workflows  
- Process clarity and reproducibility  

This portfolio highlights several representative projects that demonstrate the skills I use — and love using — in data-oriented roles.
