## Summary
Clinical data and oncology research operations professional with 20+ years of experience supporting translational research and oncology trials. Brings deep understanding of biospecimen workflows, correlative science, and clinically annotated samples, with a focus on data quality, variable definition, and metadata standards. Experienced in designing data capture forms, relational database schemas, and QC logic to support consistent, reusable clinical and operational data. Hands-on experience with SQL and Power BI, and a collaborative approach to aligning clinical, operational, and data team needs across studies.

## Clinical Data & Oncology Domain Expertise
My clinical data understanding is grounded in direct interaction with
oncology-derived clinical materials, experimental design, and downstream
analytic needs rather than primary EHR abstraction roles. I have worked
end-to-end across the lifecycle of clinical research data: from tumor
tissue acquisition and pathological processing, through biomarker
measurement and therapeutic targeting, to data modeling, analysis, and
interpretation in translational and population-scale contexts.

This perspective informs how I define variables, document assumptions, and anticipate downstream analytic use and limitations.

## Core Skills

**Biomarkers & Therapeutic Relevance**
- Designed and executed biomarker assays in translational oncology studies,
  with a deep understanding of biomarker definition, measurement error,
  and biological relevance.
- Inventor on issued U.S. patents for RNA-based therapeutics targeting
  clinically meaningful biomarkers, requiring integration of molecular,
  phenotypic, and disease-state data.

**Pathology & Specimen Handling**
- Interpreted pathology reports in real-world research settings as tumor
  tissue entered the lab; performed fixation, sectioning, staining, and
  assay preparation on clinical specimens.
- Developed practical understanding of histology, tissue quality, tumor
  content, and pre-analytic variables that directly affect downstream data
  validity.

**Treatment Context & Clinical Timelines**
- Worked with clinically annotated samples tied to treatment regimens,
  cycles, response, and progression; routinely reasoned about timing,
  exposure, and disease state when interpreting sample-derived data.
- Familiar with how treatment decisions, progression events, and clinical
  milestones must be represented and reconciled in structured datasets.

  **Analytic & Data Consumer Perspective**
- First author on a complex GWAS analysis in R, working with high-dimensional
  molecular and clinical data and addressing issues of variable construction,
  quality control, and statistical interpretation.
- Experienced in anticipating downstream analytic needs, including
  missingness, confounding, reproducibility, and documentation of
  assumptions and tradeoffs.
- Designs data structures and QC logic with the end user in mind, ensuring
  clinical and operational data can be reliably reused for analysis.
