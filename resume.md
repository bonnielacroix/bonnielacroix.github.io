## Summary
...

## Clinical Data & Oncology Domain Expertise
My clinical data understanding is grounded in direct interaction with
oncology-derived clinical materials, experimental design, and downstream
analytic needs rather than primary EHR abstraction. I have worked
end-to-end across the lifecycle of clinical research data: from tumor
tissue acquisition and pathological processing, through biomarker
measurement and therapeutic targeting, to data modeling, analysis, and
interpretation in translational and population-scale contexts.
